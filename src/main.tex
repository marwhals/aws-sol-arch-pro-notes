    \section{Rekognition Overview}
    - Find objects, people, text, scenes in images and videos using ML
    - Facial analysis and facial search to do user verification, people counting.
    - Create a database of "familiar faces" or compare against celebrities
    - Use cases:
        - Labeling
        - Content Moderation
        - Text Detection
        - Face Detection and Analysis (gender, age range, emotions....)
        - Face Search and Verification
        - Celebrity Recognition
        - Pathing (ex: for sports game analysis)

    \subsection{Amazon Rekognition - Content Moderation}
    - Detect content that is inappropriate, unwanted or offensive (image and videos)
    - Used in social media, broadcast media, advertising and e-commerce situation to create a safer user experience
    - Set a Minimum Confidence Threshold for items that will be flagged
    - Flag sensitive content for manual review in Amazon Augmented AI (A2I)
    - Help comply with regulations

    \section{Transcribe Overview}
    - Automatically convert speech to text.
    - Uses a deep learning process called automatic speech recognition (ASR) to convert speech to text quickly and accurately.
    - Automatically remove Personally Identifiable Information (PII) using Redaction.
    - Supports Automatic Language Identification for multilingual audio
    - Use cases:
        - transcribe customer service calls
        - automate closed captioning and subtitling
        - generate metadata for media assets to create a fully searchable archive

    \section{Polly Overview}
    - Turn text into lifelike speech using deep learning
    - Allowing you to create applications that talk

    \subsection{Amazon Polly - Lexicon \& SSML}
    - Customise the pronunciation of words with Pronunciation lexicons
        - Stylized words: St3ph4ne => "Stephane"
        - Acronyms: AWS => "Amazon Web Services"
    - Upload the lexicons and use them in the SynthesizeSpeech operation.
    - Generate speech from plain text or from documents marked up with Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) - enables more customisation
        - Emphasising specific words or phrases.
        - Using phonetic pronunciation.
        - Including breathing sounds, whispering.
        - Using the Newscaster speaking style

    \section{Translate Overview}
    - Natural and accurate language translation
    - Allows you to localise content - such as websites and applications - for international users and to easily translate large volumes of text efficiently.

    \section{Lex + Connect Overview}
    - Amazon Lex: (same technology that powers Alexa)
        - Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to convert speech to text
        - Natural Language Understanding to recognise the intent of text, callers
        - Helps build chatbots and call centre bots
    - Amazon Connect:
        - Receive calls, create contact flows, cloud-based virtual contact centre
        - Can integrate with other CRM systems of AWS
        - No upfront payments, 80\% cheaper than traditional contact center solutions ðŸ¤”
    \section{Comprehend Overview}
    - For Natural Language Processing - NLP
    - Fully managed and serverless service
    - Uses machine learning to find insights and relationships in text
        - Language of the text
        - Extracts key phrases, places, people, brands or events
        - Understands how positive or negative the text is
        - Analyses text using tokenization and parts of speech
        - Automatically organises a collection of text files by topic
    - Sample use cases:
        - Analyse customer interactions (emails) to find what leads to a positive or negative experience
        - Create and groups articles by topics that Comprehend will uncover
    \section{Comprehend Medical Overview}
    - Amazon Comprehend Medical detects and returns useful information in unstructured clinical text:
        - Physician's notes
        - Discharge summaries
        - Test results
        - Case notes
    - Uses NLP to detect Protected Health Information (PHI) - DetectPHI API
    - Store your documents in Amazon S3, analyse real-time data with Kinesis Data Firehose or use Amazon Transcribe to transcribe patient narratives into text that can be analysed by Amazon Comprehend Medical.
    \section{SageMaker Overview}
    - Fully managed service for developers / data scientists to build ML models
    - Typically difficult to do all processes in one place + provision servers
    \section{Kendra Overview}

    - Learn from user interactions / feedback to promote preferred results (Incremental Learning)
    - Ability to manually fine-tune search results (importance of data, freshness, customer)
    \section{Personalise Overview}
    - Fully managed ML-service to build apps with real-time personalised recommendations
    - Example: personalised product recommendations/re-ranking, customised direct marketing
        Example: User bought gardening tools, provide recommendations on the next one to buy.
    - Same technology used by Amazon.com
