    \section{IAM - What should you know by now}
    - Users: Long term credentials
    - Groups
    - Roles: short-term credentials, uses STS
    - EC2 Instance Roles: Uses the EC2 metadata service. One role of a time per instance
    - Service Roles: API Gateways, CodeDeploy etc
    - Cross Account roles
    - Policies
    - AWS Managed
    - Customer Managed
    - Inline Policies
    - Resource Based Policies (S3 Bucket, SQS queues, etc......)

    \subsection{IAM Policies Deep Dive}
    - Anatomy of a policy: JSON doc with Effect, Action, Resource, Conditions, Policy Variables
    - Explicit DENY has precedence over ALLOW
    - Best practice: use least privilege for maximum security
    - Access Advisor: See permissions granted and when last accessed
    - Access Analyser: Analyse resources that are shared with external entity
    - Navigate Examples at: %put link to AWS docs here

    \subsection{IAM AWS Managed Policies - Administrator Access example}

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=JSON, caption=Sample JSON Data, label=lst:json-example]
{
"Version": "2012-10-17",
"Statement": [
{
"Effect": "Allow",
"Action": "*",
"Resource": "*"
}
]
}
    \end{lstlisting}
    % Add other listings as required

    \subsection{IAM Policies Conditions}
    % Insert IAM policies conditions
    \subsection{IAM Policies Variables and Tags}
    % Insert listings here
    \subsection{IAM Roles vs Resource Based Policies}
    - Attach a policy to a resource (example: S3 bucket policy) versus attaching of a using a role as a proxy
%insert a diagram
    - When you assume a role (user, application or service), you give up your original permissions and take the permissions assigned to the role.
    - When using a resource-based policy, the principal doesn't have to give up any permissions
    - Example: User in account A needs to scan a DynamoDB table in Account A and dump it in an S3 bucket in Account B

    \subsection{IAM Permissions Boundaries}
    - IAM permission boundaries are supported for users and roles (not groups)
    - Advanced feature to use a managed policy to set the maximum permissions an IAM entity can get
    - Can be used in combinations of AWS organisations SCP


    \subsection{Use cases}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Delegate responsibilities to non administrators within their permission boundaries, for example create create new IAM users
        \item Allow developers to self-assign policies and managed their own permissions while making sure they can't 'escalate' their privileges (i.e make themselves admin)
        \item Useful to restrict one specific user (instead of a whole account using Organisations and SCP)
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{IAM Access Analyser}
    - Find out which resources are shared externally
        - S3 Buckets
        - IAM Roles
        - KMS Keys
        - Lambda Functions and Layers
        - SQS queues
        - Secrets Manager Secrets
    - Define Zone ofTrust = AWS Account or AWS Organisation
    - Access outside of zone trusts => findings

    \subsection{IAM Access Analyser}
    - IAM Access Analyser Policy Validation
        - Validates your policy against IAM policy grammar and best practices
        - General warnings, security warnings errors suggestions
        - Provides actionable recommendations
    - IAM Access Analyser Policy Generation
        - Generates IAM policy based on access activity
        - CloudTrail logs is reviewed to generate the policy with the fine-grained permissions and the appropriate Actions and Services
        - Reviews CloudTrail logs for up to 90 days
    
    \section{STS}
    \subsection{Using STS to Assume a Role}
    - Define an IAM Role within your account or cross-account
    - Define which principals can access this IAM role
    - Using AWS STS (Security Token Service) to retrieve credentials and impersonate the IAM role you have access to (AssumeRole API)
    - Temporary credentials can be valid between 15 to 12 hours.

    \subsection{Assuming a Role with STS}
    - Provide access for an IAM user in one AWS account that you own to access resources in another account that you own.
    - Provide access to IAM users in AWS accounts owned by third parties
    - Provide access for services offered by AWS to AWS resources
    - Provide access for externally authenticated users (identity federation)
    - Ability to revoke active sessions and credentials for a role (by adding a policy using a time statement - AWSRevokeOlderSessions)

    When you assume a role (user, application or service), you give up your original permissions and take the permissions assigned to the role.

    \subsection{Providing Access to an IAM User in Yours or Another AWS Account That You Own}
    - You can grant your IAM users permissions to switch to roles within your AWS account or to roles defined in other AWS accounts that you own.
    %Diagram
    - Benefits:
        - You must explicitly grant your users permission to assume the role
        - Your users must actively switch to the role using the AWS management console or assume the role using the AWS CLI or AWS API
        - You can add multi-factor authentication (MFA) protection to the role so that only users who sign in with an MFA device can assume the role.
        - Least Privilege + auditing using CloudTrail
    %Diagram

    \subsection{Providing Access to AWS Accounts Owned by Third Parties}
    - Zone of trust = accounts, organisations that you own
    - Outside Zone ofTrust = 3rd parties
    - Use IAM Access Analyser to find out which resources are exposed
    - For granting access to a thrid party:
        - The third part AWS account ID
        - An External ID (secret between you and the third party)
            - To uniquely associate with the role between you and 3rd party
            - Must be provided when defining the trust and when assuming the role
            - Must be chosen by the third party
        - Define permissions in the IAM policy

    %The confused deputy, diagram

    \subsubsection{Session Tags in STS}
    - Tags that you pass when you assume an IAM Role or federate user in STS
    - aws:PrincipalTag Condition
        - Compares the tags attached to the principal making the request with the tag you specified in the policy.
        - Example: Allow a principal to pass session tags only if the principal making the reqeust has the specified tags.
    % diagram

    \subsubsection{STS Important APIs}
    - AssumeRole: access a role within your account or cross-account
    - AssumeRoleWithSAML: return credentials for users logged with SAML
    - AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity: return creds for users logged with an IdP
        - Example providers include Amazon Cognito, Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google or any OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider.
        - AWS Recommends using Cognito
    - GetSessionToken: for MFA from a user or AWS account root user
    - GetFederationToken: obtain temporary creds for a federated user, usually a proxy app that will give the creds for a federated user, usually a proxy app that will give the creds to a distributed app inside a corporate network.
    
    \subsection{Identity Federation in AWS}
    - Give users outside of AWS permissions to access AWS resources in your account
    - You don't need to create IAM Users (user management is outside AWS)
    - Use cases:
        - A corporate has its own identity system (e.g Active Directory)
        - Web / Mobile application that needs access to AWS resources
    - Identity Federation can have many flavours:
        - SAML 2.0
        - Custom Identity Broker
        - Web Identity Federation With(out) Amazon Cognito
        - IAM Identity Centre

    \subsubsection{SAML 2.0 Federation}
    - Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0 (SAML 2.0)
    - Open standard used by many identity providers (e.g ADFS)
        - Supports integration with Microsoft Active Directory Federations Services (ADFS)
        - Or any SAML 2.0 - compatible IdPs with AWS
    - Access the AWS Console, AWS CLI or AWS API using temporary credentials
        - No need to create IAM Users for each of your employees
        - Need to setup a trust between AWS IAM and SAML 2.0 Identity Provider (both ways)
    - Under-the-hood: Uses the STS API AssumeRoleWithSAML
    - SAML 2.0 Federation is the "old way", IAM Identity Center Federation is the new managed and simpler way

    \subsubsection{SAML 2.0 Federation - AWS Console Access}
    % Diagram here

    \subsubsection{SAML 2.0 Federation - Active Directory DS (ADFS)}
    % Diagram here

    \subsubsection{Custom Identity Broker Application}
    - Use only if identity provider is NOT compatible with SAML 2.0
    - The identity broker is NOT compatible with SAML 2.0
    - The identity broker must determine the appropriate IAM Role
    - Uses the STS API AssumeRole or GetFederationToken
    % Diagrams

    \subsubsection{Web Identity Federation - Without Cognito}
    - Not recommended by AWS - use cognito instead
    % Insert a diagram

    \subsubsection{Web Identity Federation - With Cognito}
    - Preferred over for Web Identity Federation
        - Create IAM Roles using Cognito with the least privilege needed
        - Build trust between the OIDC IdP and AWS
    - Cognito benefits:
        - Supports anonymous users
        - Supports MFA
        - Data Synchronisation
    - Cognito replaces a Token Vending Machine (TVM)
    %Insert a diagram

    \subsubsection{Web Identity Federation - IAM Policy}
    - After being authenticated with Web Identity Federation, you can identify the user with an IAM policy variable
    - Example:

    \subsubsection{AWS Microsoft Managed AD - Integrations}
    %Add diagram

    \subsubsection{Connect to on-premise AD}
    - Ability to connect your on-premise Active Directory to AWS Managed Microsoft AD
    - Must establish a Direct Connection (DX) or VPN connection
    - Can setup three kinds of forest trust
        - One-way trust: AWS -> On-Premise
        - One-way trust: On-Premise -> AWS
        - Two-way forest: trust - AWS -> On-Premise
    - Forest trust is different than synchronisation (replication is not supported)

    \subsubsection{Solution Achitecture: Active Directory Replication}
    - You may want to create a replica of your AD on EC2 in the cloud to minimise latency of in case DX or VPN goes down
    - Establish trust between the AWS Manged Microsoft AD and EC2
    % Diagram here

    \subsubsection{AWS Directory Services AD Connector}
    - AD Connector is a directory gateway to redirect director requests to your on premises Microsoft Active Directory
    - No caching capability
    - Managed users solely on-premise, no possibility of setting up a trust
    - VPN or Direct Connect
    - Doesn't work with SQL Server, doesn't do seamless joining, can't share director.

    - No trust relationship

    \subsection{AWS Orgnisations}
    %Diagram
    \subsubsection{AWS Organisations - OrgnizationAccountAccessRole}
    %Diagram
    - IAM role which grants full administrator permissions in the Member account to the Management account
    - Used to perform admin tasks in the Member accounts (e.g - creating IAM users)
    - Could be assumed by IAM users in the Management account
    - Automatically added to all new Member account created with AWS organisations
    - Must be created manually if you invite an existing Member account

    \subsubsection{Multi Account Strategies}
    - Create accounts per department, per cost centre, per dev / test / prod, based on regulatory restrictions (using SCP), for better resource isolation (ex:VPC), to have separate per-account service limits isolated account for logging.
    - Multi Account vs. On Account MultiVPC
    - Use tagging standards for billing purposes
    - Enable CloudTrail on all accounts, send logs to central S3 account
    - Send CloudWatch logs to central logging account
    - Strategy to create an account for security

    \subsubsection{Orgnisational Units (OU) - Examples}
    %Insert diagrams here

    \subsubsection{AWS Organisation - Feature Modes}
    - Consolidated billing features:
        - Consolidated Billing across all accounts - single payment method
        - Pricing benefits from aggregated usage (volume discount for EC2, S3.....)

    \subsubsection{All Features (Default)}
        - Includes consolidated billing features, SCP
        - Invited accounts must approve enabling all features
        - Ability to apply an SCP to prevent member accounts from leaving the org
        - Can't switch back to Consolidated Billing Features only

    \subsubsection{AWS Organisations - Reserved Instances}
    - For billing purposes, the consolidated billing features of AWS organisations treats all the accounts in the organisation as one account.
    - The means that all accounts in the organisation can receive the hourly cost benefit of Reserved Instances that are purchased by any other account.
    - The payer account (Management account) of an organisation can turn off Reserved Instance (RI) discount and Saving Plans discount sharing for any accounts in that organisation, including the payer account.
    - This means that RIs and Saving Plans discounts aren't shared between any accounts that have sharing turned off.
    - To share an RI or Savings Plans discount with an account, both accounts must have sharing turned on.

    \subsubsection{AWS Organisation - Moving Accounts}
    - Remove the member account from the AWS organisation
    - Send an invite to the member account from the AWS organisation
    - Accept the invite to the new Organisation from the member account.
    %Diagram

    \subsubsection{Service Control Policies (SCP)}
    - Define allowlist or blocklist IAM actions
    - Applied at the OU or Account level
    - Does not apply to the Management Account
    - SCP is applied to all the Users and Roles in the account, including Root user
    - The SCP does not affect Service-linked roles
        - Service-linked roles enable other AWS services to integrate with AWS organisations and can't be restricted by SCP's
    - SCP must have an explicit Allow from the root of each OU in the direct path to the target account (does not allow anything by default)
    - Use cases:
        - Restrict access to certain services (for example: can't use EMR)
        - Enforce PCI compliance by explicitly disabling services.

    \subsubsection{SCP Hierarchy}
    %Insert diagram
    - Management Account - Can do anything (no SCP apply)

        - Can do anything
        - EXCEPT S3 (explicit Deny from Sandbox OU)
        - EXCEPT EC2 (explicit deny)
    - Account B and C
        - Can do anything
        - EXCEPT S3 (explicit Deny from Sandbox OU)
    - Account D
        - Can access EC2
    - Prod OU and Account E and F

    \subsubsection{IAM Policy Evaluation Logic}
    %Diagram and reference to amazon docs

    \subsubsection{Restricting Tags with IAM policies}
    - You can restrict specific tags on AWS resources
    - Using the aws:TagKeys Condition Key
        - Validate the Tag Keys attached to a resource against the Tag Keys in the IAM Policy
    - Example: Allow IAM users to create EBS Volumes only if it has the "Env" and "CostCenter" Tags
    - Use either ForAllValues (must have all keys) or ForAnyValue (must have any of these keys at a minimum)

    %Add JSON tags here

    \subsubsection{Using SCP to restrict creating resources without appropriate tags}
    - Prevent IAM Users/Roles in the affected member accounts from creating resources if they don't have a specific Tag
    % Add JSON example here

    \subsubsection{AWS Organisations - Tag Policies}
    - Helps you standardise tags across resources in an AWS organisation
    - Ensure consistent tags, audit tagged resources, maintain proper resources categorisation
    - You define Tag keys and their allowed values
    - Helps with AWS Cost Allocation Tags and Attribute-based Access Control
    - Prevent any non-compliant tagging operations on specified services and resources
    - Generate a report that lists all tagged/ non compliant resources
    - Use Amazon EventBridge to monitor non-compliant tags

    \subsubsection{AWS Organisation - AI Service Opt-out Policies}
    - Certain AWS AI services may use your content for continuous improvement of Amazon AI/ML services
    - Example: Amazon Lex, Amazon Comprehend, Amazon Polly.........
    - You can opt-out of having your content stored or used by AWS AI services
    - Create an Opt-out Policy that enforces this setting across all Member accounts and AWS Regions
    - You can opt-out all AI services or selected services
    - Can be attached to Organisation Root, specific OU or individual Member account

    \subsubsection{AWS Organisations - Backup policies}
    - AWS Backup enables you to create Backup Plans that define how to backup your AWS resources
    - JSON Documents that define backup plans across an AWS Organisation
    - Gives you granular control over backup up your resources (e.g backup frequency, time window, backup region,.....)
    - Can be attached to Organisation Root, specific OU or individual Member account
    - Immutable backup plans appear in Member accounts (view only)

        - Provide required URLs, certificates and metadata
    - Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
        - Fine-grained permissions based on users' attributes stored in IAM identity center identity store
        - Example: Cost center, title, locale
        - Use case: Define permission once, then modify AWS access by changing the attributes

    \subsubsection{AWS Control Tower}
    - Easy way to setup and govern a secure and compliant multi-account AWS environment based on best practices
    - Benefits:
        - Automate the set up of your environment in a few clicks
